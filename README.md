##Business
The business of this project is very easy, it is a simply exam-online web site. The idea is form the trainning of thoughtworks.
 1.There are some exam which inclue some questions;
 2.There are two roles in the website:teacher, student;
 3.The teacher could create,delete and edite the exam;
 4.The student could join the exam which is published and answer the question in the exam;
 5.When the student finish the exam,he could submit his answers;
 6.The teacher could review the grade of student in any time.

That's all, please enjoy!
